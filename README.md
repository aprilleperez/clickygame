# Clicky Game - Sailor Moon Edition

## Description
This app was created purely from React, an HTML/Javascript hybrid frontend UI library that dynamically changes the UI based on components and props. The game itself presents 12 cards, the theme based off of Sailor Moon. The goal of the game is to click each of the 12 cards only once to get a top score of 12. Otherwise, a card clicked more than once will restart your current score. On each click of the cards, they will shuffle their location on the screen, so do your best to remember who you clicked!

## Languages

## Important
Please be sure to $npm install gh-pages, as well as confirm that the created react app includes these as dependencies: react, react-dom, react-scripts. To run this app locally, run $npm start.

## Takeaways
React is a huge upgrade and climb from pure HTML and a separated Javascript file. It was really challenging to get started and to navigate all the files that create-react-app initializes, but nonetheless this was good practice. I had a bit of an a-ha moment towards the end of finishing the MVP of understanding the relationship between child-parent components and the props that link them all together. I definitely need more practice to feel confident in it, but it was a win to come to that understanding.
