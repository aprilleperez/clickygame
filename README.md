# Clicky Game - Sailor Moon Edition

## Description
This app was created purely from React, an HTML/Javascript hybrid frontend UI library that dynamically changes the UI based on components and props. The game itself presents 12 cards, the theme based off of Sailor Moon. The goal of the game is to click each of the 12 cards only once to get a top score of 12. Otherwise, a card clicked more than once will restart your current score. On each click of the cards, they will shuffle their location on the screen, so do your best to remember who you clicked!

## Languages

## Important
Please be sure to $npm install gh-pages, as well as confirm that the created react app includes these as dependencies: react, react-dom, react-scripts. To run this app locally, run $npm start.
